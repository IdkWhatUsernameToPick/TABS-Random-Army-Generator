# TABS-Random-Army-Generator

The original project was made by iCeParadox64: https://github.com/iCeParadox64/Totally-Accurate-Battle-Simulator-Random-Team-Generator/blob/main/tabs-rtg.py

Edits I made: 
added the Legacy faction,
added the Fantasy good faction,
added the Fentasy Evil faction,
added the Secret faction,
now the minimum cost is 30 instead of 50.
