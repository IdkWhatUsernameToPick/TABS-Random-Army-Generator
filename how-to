To use this in Python (the harder way), you have to:
1. Download the "TABS Random Team Generator.py" file.
2. Drag the file where it will be easily accessible.
3. If you have Python (which is free, you can download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/), double-click the file and open it in Python.
4. If you don`t have Python, you will have to follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bp1OavluQ&ab_channel=LearningLad. You may skip to 4:10.
5. Input the amount of money you want the army to cost.
6. The army scheme will appear.
7. Done!

To use this as an exe (the easier way), you have to:
1. Download the "TABS Random Team Generator.exe" file.
2. Open it.
3. Input the amount of money you want the army to cost.
4. The army scheme will appear.
5. Done!

You can easily add custom units. Make sure AddUnit.py and GeneratorTest.py are in the same folder. Open AddUnit.py. Fill out the name, faction, and cost. The new unit will appear in GeneratorTest.py. Keep in mind that setting the cost of an army less than 20 will not generate results.
